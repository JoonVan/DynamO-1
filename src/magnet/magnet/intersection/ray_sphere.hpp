      This uses only a slightly specialised form of the general stable
      EDMD algorithm, so the inverse sphere test is obtained by simply
      flipping the sign of the quadratic coefficients (through the
      inverse template parameter).

      \param V The direction/velocity of the ray.
      \param r The radius of the sphere.
      \param inv_gamma The expansion rate of the sphere.
      \param t_curr The time passed since the sphere had a radius of r.
      \return The time until the intersection, or HUGE_VAL if no intersection.
